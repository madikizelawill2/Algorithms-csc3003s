# Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of algorithms covered in the Theory of Algorithms section of CSC3003S at the University of Cape Town, plus a few extra ones.

## Purpose

I created this repository to deepen my understanding of algorithms through hands-on implementation. By coding these algorithms myself, I've found it to be the most effective way to grasp their concepts and intricacies.

## Who is this for?

- Students taking CSC3003S at the University of Cape Town
- Anyone learning about algorithms and data structures
- Developers looking for reference implementations of common algorithms

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Brute force
2. Divide and Conquer
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Binary Search
   - Closest Pair Search
   - Euclid's Algorithm
   - Fake Coin
   - Finding K'th Search (Stastic)
   - Generating Permutations
   - Insertion Sort
   - Interpolation Search
   - Merge Sort
   - Multiplication a la Russe
   - Quicksort
   - Quick Hull
   - Topological Sort

3. Dynamic Programming
   - Fibonacci Sequence
   - Longest Common Subsequence

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/madikizelawill2/algorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory.
3. Run the implementation file (instructions may vary based on the programming language used).

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I'm open to contributions. If you'd like to add an algorithm implementation or improve an existing one:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewAlgorithm`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add NewAlgorithm implementation'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewAlgorithm`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
